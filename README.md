# sapper-meet-us
A Meetup website for learning Svelte. Coded along with the course 'Svelte.js - The Complete Guide (incl. Sapper.js)' by Maximilian Schwarzmüller.

Sapper is a framework for building web applications of all sizes, with a beautiful development experience and flexible filesystem-based routing.

Unlike single-page apps, Sapper doesn't compromise on SEO, progressive enhancement or the initial load experience — but unlike traditional server-rendered apps, navigation is instantaneous for that app-like feel.
